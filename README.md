# Uniquely-Decodable-Code-UDC

Here, I am attaching the code for identifying the entered symbols and their codewords are Uniquely Decodable codes or not. It also includes the code for checking whether the entered code-words are prefixed code-words or not. 


# Input 
First, enter the no. of symbols you have.
Second, start entering the symbols and their code-words.


NOTE: Program will ask you what to enter at which point.

# Output
It will display you whether the entered code-words are UDC or not UDC.
